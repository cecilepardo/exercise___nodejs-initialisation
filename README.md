This project was created as part of a Node.js learning exercise.

## Purpose

The goal of this repository is to practice initializing a Node.js project and understanding basic concepts such as:
- project structure
- using `package.json`
- creating a simple entry point (`index.js`)

- Understanding `package.json` and dependencies
- Creating and running a simple Node.js application
- Structuring files for a Node.js project

## Status

This is a learning project and is not intended for production use.
